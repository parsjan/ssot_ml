there are syntax rules for the MIG configuration lines in your .txt file. Each line should represent a valid MIG profile name, following the format supported by your A100 80GB GPU.


 Syntax Rule Format:
 <GiCount>g.<Memory>gb

GiCount = Number of GPU instances (1–7 depending on GPU model)
Memory = Amount of memory per instance (in GB)

The whole profile must be supported by the GPU (you can’t just write arbitrary combinations)

Valid MIG profiles for A100 80GB:
Here are the standard profile strings you can use in your text file:

| Profile String | GPU Slices | Memory |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| `1g.10gb`      | 1/7        | 10 GB  |
| `2g.20gb`      | 2/7        | 20 GB  |
| `3g.40gb`      | 3/7        | 40 GB  |
| `7g.80gb`      | Full GPU   | 80 GB  |

Note: You can't exceed the total resources of the GPU. For example, you can’t define 9 instances of 1g.10gb on a single A100.

Example mig_config.txt (Valid):
1g.10gb
1g.10gb
2g.20gb
3g.40gb

This will consume the entire 80 GB and all slices of the GPU (10 + 10 + 20 + 40 = 80 GB).
